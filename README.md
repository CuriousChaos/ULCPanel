# ULCPanel
Universal Linux Control Panel


A project in Shell I've been making.
This is the simplest version and is free.

When installed, use this:


`chmod +x directory placed in/*.sh`

and   
`chmod +x directory placed in/scripts/*.sh`   
  
  
Obviously, this is for any distribution of Linux, and is made to be versatile.
Please make sure to report any non-user problems with this software.
