# ULCPanel-Base
## Universal Linux Control Panel


An open-source project for Linux distributions. This is the BASE version.

When installed, use this:


`chmod +x directory placed in/*.sh`

and   

`chmod +x directory placed in/scripts/*.*`   
  
To ensure all the files work. The only things that should be in *`/scripts`* are shell files, so no need to worry.
  
  
Obviously, this is for any distribution of Linux, and is made to be versatile.
Please make sure to report any non-user problems with this software.
