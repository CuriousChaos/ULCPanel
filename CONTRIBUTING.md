# Contributing to the Universal Linux Control Panel project

To begin, thank you for wanting to contribute to our project!

This short guideline ... guide will just describe the reccomended guidelines for creating new scripts for ULCPanel. These are
not rules, just reccomendations. If you follow these, it will be more likely to be added to our project. If this guideline guide
seems incomplete, feel free to make a Pull Request to make changes.


## What do I need to know about this project?

ULCPanel is a program designed to be Open-Source and simple. We don't want to remake the scripts we have designed, so
take a look around the `/scripts` folder to see what we have so you can make something we *don't* have.

We are planning to have multiple projects and containing folders centered around different "topics," so keep that in mind.

## What are the plans for this project?

We don't have any specific plans for this, other than it just being an open-source Control Panel.

However, we do have a few ideas:

* Make a marketable, professional version.

* Integrate multiple languages into the system.

* Set up different repositories for different uses, based off this version.

## How do I contribute?

Well, glad you asked!


### Bug Reporting

You can report bugs to us, which will really help us to refine the project. Just make sure you look at the ones
already reported so you don't make another report.

Format a report like this:

> # Title

> ## Quick Description

> ### What should have happened?

> blah blah blah

> ### What *did* happen?

> blah blah blah

> ### Who, what, when, and where? (We need to know your specs, circumstances, etc)

> blah blah blah

> ### How might we be able to recreate the situation?

> blah blah blah

### Suggestions on enhancing

If you have an idea of what changes should take place in a script or suite, make sure to tell us!
Feedback is important.

Just remember to be detailed about it and maybe provide some code or examples to help us.

### Contributing code

Oooh! Made a script or want to solve a problem we have? We'd love to list you as a contributor, so code on!

Ensure your code fits these guidlines:

* Is well-organized

* Has been tested at least a little bit with ULCPanel

* Solves a problem or makes a good addition to ULCPanel, and doesn't already exist.


### Pull requests

If you want to make some changes, make a pull request that fits this template:

> ## How many issues might this fix?
> ## What files/directories will this change?
> ### List your proposed changes here...
> blah blah blah
> ## Mention others who helped here
> blah blah blah
> ### Give us a reason why we should accept this Pull Request!

## Are there any symbols to include when contributing?

Yes, yes there are! These will help us understand what *exactly* it will help us with.

Here's a list of GitHub ... emojis to use.

* :art: `:art:` Use this when suggesting code to use.

* :racehorse: `:racehorse:` Use this when suggesting how we could improve performance.

* :lock: `:lock:` Use this when suggesting how we could improve security.

* :bug: `:bug:` Use this when suggesting a bug and how we might fix it.

* :non-potable_water: `:non-potable_water:` Use this when suggesting how we could improve the flow of things.

* :memo: `:memo:` Use this when making a note of something.

## Also, make sure to:
